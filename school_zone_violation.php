				<h2>School Zone Violation</h2>
				<p>If a person is convicted of a drug crime and that person was within 1000 feet of a school, or 100 feet of a public park or playground then there is an additional penalty which will be added on to the sentence for the underlying offense.</p>
				<h3>Penalties</h3>
				<p>If a person is found guilty of a drug crime within the above distances then they could face up to an additional 15 years in a state prison or a $10,000 fine in addition to the sentence for the predicate offense. The prosecution does not have to prove that the defendant had knowledge that they were within the required distances. This means that even if the defendant was unaware that they were near a school, park or playground they could still be subject to additional penalties.</p>
