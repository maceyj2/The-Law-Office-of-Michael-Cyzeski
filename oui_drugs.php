				<h2>OUI Drugs</h2>
				<p>Operating under the influence of drugs is essentially the same crime as operating under the influence of liquor in Massachusetts. The penalties for OUI drugs are the same as OUI liquor and the prosecution must prove the same three things beyond a reasonable doubt in order to obtain a conviction. These three things or elements are:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant was operating a motor vehicle</li>
					<li>on a public way</li>
					<li>while doing so the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating drugs</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As in OUI liquor cases, most of the time it is the third element that is in dispute. In many cases it is much harder for the prosecution to prove that a person was under the influence of drugs while driving than it is for a OUI liquor. The general public has less knowledge about the effects of drugs on a person than it does liquor. <span class="excerpt">In many cases it is much harder for the prosecution to prove that a person was under the influence of drugs while driving than it is for a OUI liquor.</span>For example, in many OUI liquor police reports the arresting officer will say that there was an odor of alcohol coming from the defendant, this is not the case in an OUI drugs situation. In addition, the substance in which the prosecution claims that a person is impaired by must be a banned substance. Therefore if someone has a certain prescription for a medicine and drives, although this person maybe should not have been driving, the prosecution could not convict this person for OUI drugs because the substance was not a banned substance.</p>
