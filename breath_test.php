				<h2>Breath Test</h2>
				<p>The legal limit for Blood alcohol content (BAC) in Massachusetts is .08, and for anyone under the age of 21 is .02. This means that anyone age 21 or over who takes the breathalyzer and blows a .08 or higher will have been deemed to have failed the test. The important thing to realize is that just because someone failed the breath test and is allegedly intoxicated it does not mean that the test cannot be disputed. <span class="excerpt">The important thing to realize is that just because someone failed the breath test and is allegedly intoxicated it does not mean that the test cannot be disputed.</span>There are many ways a skilled attorney can dispute the results of the breath test. The defendant's health conditions could have interfered with the result of the test like gastric reflux or oral health issues. The breathalyzer machine must be properly maintained and the police officer who administered the test must be trained how to apply the test properly and follow the correct procedures in applying it. These are just some of the ways that a breathalyzer can be disputed.</p>
				<p>It is also important to realize that a person can refuse to take the breathalyzer. In Massachusetts there is a implied consent law when obtaining a drivers license, which means that when a person gets a drivers license they consent to taking a breathalyzer if asked to. If the person refuses to take the breathalyzer then the RMV will suspend that person's driver's license. The suspension periods are listed below. However even though the RMV will suspend a person's license upon a refusal, <span class="excerpt">Even though the RMV will suspend a person's license upon a refusal, it is usually the best course of action to refuse the test.</span>it is usually the best course of action to refuse the test. A failed breathalyzer is a strong piece of evidence against a defendant in a OUI Case and a person refusing the test deprives the prosecution of this evidence. The prosecution also cannot introduce the fact that the defendant refused the test at trial. If the defendant is found not guilty or the case is dismissed then a motion for the judge to order the RMV to reinstate that person's license can be filed. If the judge grants this motion then the RMV will be forced to reinstate the defendant's license ending any suspension for refusing the breathalyzer.</p>
				<h3>License Suspension Periods for Refusing a Chemical Test</h3>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>No prior OUI offenses: 180 days</li>
					<li>1 prior OUI offense: 3 years</li>
					<li>2 prior OUI offenses: 5 years</li>
					<li>3 or more prior OUI offenses: Life</li>
					<li>The suspension for a failed breathalyzer (.08 or above) is 30 days or until the conclusion of the court case whichever is shorter</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These above suspensions are independent of any suspensions issued by the court.</p>
