				<h2>Larceny by Embezzlement</h2>
				<p>Embezzlement is a serious crime in Massachusetts. A person convicted of embezzlement faces imprisonment as well as fines. In order to be convicted of embezzlement the prosecution must prove three things:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant while in a position of trust or confidence, was entrusted with possession of property belonging to another person or entity</li>
					<li>the defendant took that property, hid it or converted it to his own use without consent of the owner</li>
					<li>the defendant did so with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If a person is convicted of embezzlement and the property which was embezzled is valued at over $250 then that person faces up to 5 years in a state prison of a fine of up to $25,000. If the property which was embezzled is valued at under $250 then that person faces up to 1 year in a house of correction and a $300 fine.</p>
