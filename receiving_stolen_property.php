				<h2>Receiving Stolen Property</h2>
				<p>A person convicted of receiving stolen property faces imprisonment as well as fines. In order for a person to be convicted of receiving stolen property the prosecution must prove three things:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the property in question was stolen</li>
					<li>the defendant knew that the property had been stolen</li>
					<li>the defendant knowingly had the property in his possession, bought the stolen property or aided in concealing the stolen property</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the value of the stolen property is valued at over $250 a conviction could lead to 5 years in state prison or a $500 fine. If the value of the stolen property is valued at under $250 then a conviction could lead to 2.5 years in a house of correction and a $250 fine.</p>
