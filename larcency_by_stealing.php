				<h2>Larceny by Stealing</h2>
				<p>A person convicted of larceny by stealing faces jail time as well as fines. In order for a person to be convicted of larceny by stealing the prosecution must prove three things:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant took and carried away property</li>
					<li>the property was owned or possessed by someone else other than the defendant</li>
					<li>the defendant did so with the intent to deprive that person of the property permanently</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If a person is convicted of larceny by stealing and the property which was embezzled is valued at over $250 then that person faces up to 5 years in a state prison of a fine of up to $25,000. If the property which was embezzled is valued at under $250 then that person faces up to 1 year in a house of correction and a $300 fine.</p>
