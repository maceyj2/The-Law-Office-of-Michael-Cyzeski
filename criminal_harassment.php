				<h2>Criminal Harassment</h2>
				<p>Criminal harassment is a serious crime in Massachusetts. A conviction of criminal harassment could lead to jail time as well as fines. In order to be convicted of criminal harassment the prosecution must prove that:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant knowingly engaged in a pattern of conduct or speech, or a series of acts, on at least three separate occasions directed at the alleged victim</li>
					<li>these acts were of a kind that would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress</li>
					<li>those actions did in fact cause the alleged victim to become seriously alarmed</li>
					<li>the defendant engaged in those actions willfully and maliciously</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A person convicted of criminal harassment could face up to 2.5 years in a house of correction and up to a $1000 fine for a first offense and up to 10 years in a state prison for a subsequent offense.</p>
