				<h2>Motor Vehicle Theft</h2>
				<p>Motor vehicle theft is a serious crime in Massachusetts. A person convicted of motor vehicle theft faces significant imprisonment as well as significant fines. There are two ways a person could be charged with theft of a motor vehicle. The first was is that the person stole the motor vehicle. The second way is that the person stole a part from that motor vehicle. In order for a person to be convicted of motor vehicle theft the prosecution must prove three things:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant took and left with a motor vehicle or parts from a motor vehicle</li>
					<li>the motor vehicle or parts were owned or possessed by someone other than the defendant</li>
					<li>the defendant did so with the intent to deprive that person of the motor vehicle or parts permanently</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A person convicted of motor vehicle theft faces up to 15 years in state prison or a fine of up to $15,000.</p>
