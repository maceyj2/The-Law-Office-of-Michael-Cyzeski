				<h2>Drug Crimes</h2>
				<p>Any drug charge in Massachusetts is a serious matter. A person can face jail time as well as fines if convicted of a drug crime. There are also other impacts on a person's life if convicted of a drug crime including difficulty obtaining a job, difficulty attending school, difficulty in obtaining professional licenses as well as driver's license suspensions. In many cases the police, in order to find a drug, have conducted a search of a person, motor vehicle or home. If this search was conducted illegally then the evidence obtained from this search will not be allowed to be introduced at trial. The prosecution must also have the substance tested and prove that it was in fact the controlled substance in question.</p>
