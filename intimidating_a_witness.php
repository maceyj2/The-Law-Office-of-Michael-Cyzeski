				<h2>Intimidating a Witness</h2>
				<p>Intimidation of a witness is a serious crime in Massachusetts. A conviction of intimidating a witness could lead to imprisonment as well as fines. In order to be convicted of witness intimidation the prosecution must prove that:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant directly or indirectly made a threat or caused or attempted to cause injury or property damage to another person</li>
					<li>that other person was a witness or potential witness</li>
					<li>the defendant did so willfully with the specific intent to interfere with an investigation or court proceeding</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A person convicted of intimidating a witness could face up to 10 years in a state prison and a fine of up to $5000.</p>
