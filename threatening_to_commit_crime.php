				<h2>Threatening to Commit a Crime</h2>
				<p>Threatening to commit a crime is a crime in Massachusetts. A conviction of threatening to commit a crime could lead to imprisonment as well as fines. In order to be convicted of threatening to commit a crime the prosecution must prove that:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>the defendant expressed an intent to injure the alleged victim or his property now or in the future</li>
					<li>the defendant intended that it be conveyed to the alleged victim</li>
					<li>the injury that was threatened, if carried out would constitute a crime</li>
					<li>the defendant made the threat under circumstances which would reasonably have caused the alleged victim to fear that the defendant had both the intention and the ability to carry out the threat</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A person convicted of threatening to commit a crime could face up to 6 months imprisonment and up to a $200 fine.</p>
