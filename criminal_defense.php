It is important to understand <span class="excerpt">Attorney Cyzeski was able to work for the District Attorney's Office while in Law School so he was able to learn how the prosecution works in building evidence and prosecuting cases and now he uses that knowledge while defending his clients.</span> that a person charged with a crime is afforded many rights under the United States Constitution as well as the Massachusetts Declaration of rights. Some of these rights include the right to remain silent and not talk to police, the right to an Attorney and the right to see all of the evidence that the state intends to use against a person. It is also important to understand that the prosecution has the burden of proof meaning that they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone committed the crime; that person does not have to prove that he or she did not commit the crime.</p>
