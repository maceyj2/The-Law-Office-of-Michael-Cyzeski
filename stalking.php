				<h2>Stalking</h2>
				<p>Stalking is a serious crime in Massachusetts. A conviction of stalking could lead to imprisonment as well as fines. In order to be convicted of stalking the prosecution must prove that:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">
					<li>over a period of time the defendant knowingly engaged in a pattern of conduct or series of acts, involving at least three incidents directed at the alleged victim</li>
					<li>those acts were of a kind that would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress</li>
					<li>those acts did in fact cause the alleged victim to become seriously alarmed or annoyed</li>
					<li>the defendant did those actions willfully and maliciously</li>
					<li>the defendant also made a threat with the intention of placing the alleged victim in imminent fear of death or bodily injury</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A person convicted of stalking could face up to 5 years in a state prison and up to a $1000 fine for a first offense and up to 10 years in a state prison for a subsequent offense.</p>
