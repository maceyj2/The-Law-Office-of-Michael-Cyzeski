				<h2>DUI / OUI</h2>

The person most likely is worried about how he or she will get around without a license, what<span class="excerpt">There are ways to refute all of this potential evidence and just because the police say that a person is intoxicated does not mean that the prosecution can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in court.</span> punishment the court is going to give them, what punishment the Registry of Motor Vehicles is going to give them. The penalties in Massachusetts for operating under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be severe. It is important to have a skilled attorney represent you through this process. Attorney Cyzeski will vigorously defend his clients on any OUI/DUI charge and is available for a free consultation regarding your case.</p>
				<p>In order to be convicted of OUI/DUI the prosecution must prove three things beyond a reasonable doubt. These three things are:</p>
				<ul class="content_list">

					<li>on a public way (public way)</li>
					<li>while doing so the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs (impairment)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In most cases the third element is the one which will be in dispute. The police use many pieces of evidence to attempt to prove that the defendant is under the influence of alcohol. Some of this evidence includes the police officer's observations of the defendant, any field sobriety tests and any breath tests. There are ways to refute all of this potential evidence and just because the police say that a person is intoxicated does not mean that the prosecution can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in court.
