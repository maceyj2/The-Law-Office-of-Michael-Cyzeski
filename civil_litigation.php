				<h2>Civil Litigation</h2>
				<h3>Personal Injury</h3>
				<p>A serious injury can change a person's life forever. An injured person's daily activities that were once taken for granted can now be extremely difficult to do. Attorney Cyzeski will work hard to make sure his clients are compensated for any injuries that were suffered because of the carelessness  of another person or company. Attorney Cyzeski will represent clients who have suffered injuries from motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, truck accidents, dog bites and dog attacks, slip and fall accidents, defective products, work related injuries, construction site injuries and any injuries suffered on another person's property. Contact Attorney Cyzeski for a free consultation regarding your case.</p>
				<h3>Breach of Contract/Small Claims</h3>
				<p>It can be frustrating as a small business owner when a customer is not paying what they owe. It seems unfair that you did the work, and paid your employees and now the customer is not fulfilling their obligation. Attorney Cyzeski will represent people in breach of contract claims and in small claims court.</p>
